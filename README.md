# Go Fundamentals

## 💡 Repository's Idea

This repository was created while studying the Go programming language. It aims to provide a set of examples on how to use different concepts of the Go programming language.

## 🔍 Features

Examples on how to use Go's features, such as:

* Packages;
* Variables;
* Data types;
* Functions;
* Operators;
* Structs;
* Pointers;

* Testing;

## 🛠 Technologies

During the development of this project, the following technologies were used:

- [Go](https://go.dev/)

## 💻 Configuration

### First, you must [install Go](https://go.dev/dl/) on your computer.

## ⏯️ Running

Here's a set of useful commands when using Go:

```bash
$ go help # Show the different available commands
$ go run [fileName.go] # Running Go files
$ go mod init [moduleName] # Creating new modules (similar to JavaScript "package.json" files)
$ go build # Creating executable files
$ go install # Creating executable files and saving in the directory where Go is installed
$ go get [packageUrl] # Installs external packages, for example: "go get github.com/badoux/checkmail"
$ go mod tidy # Remove unused packages from the "go.mod" file
$ go test # Run the test codes ("filename_test.go") from the directory where the command was executed
```
